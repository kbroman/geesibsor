----------------------------------------------------------------------
This explains the installation of the geesibsor package for R.  If you

<broman@wisc.edu>.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

OBTAINING R

  You can download R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).
  Visit http://cran.r-project.org or a local mirror (for example,
  http://cran.us.r-project.org).  Source code is available for Unix,
  and binaries are available for Windows, MacOS, and many versions of
  Linux.


OBTAINING R/geesibsor

  You can obtain the latest version of R/geesibsor from

      http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/software

  Copies of R/geesibsor will also be placed on CRAN (cran.r-project.org),
  but the version at the above site will be updated more frequently.
  Binaries are available for Windows and MacOS; source code is
  available for Unix.


INSTALLATION OF R AND R/geesibsor (Windows)

  1. The Windows version of R is distributed as a single file,
     SetupR.exe.  Install R by executing this file.  We recommend
     installing R in "c:\R" rather than "c:\Program Files\R".  Why
     didn't Microsoft use "Programs" rather than "Program files"?

  2. To install R/geesibsor, you may do one of the following:

     Start R.  Select (on the menu bar) "Packages" and then
     "Install package from local zip file...".  Find the file
     "geesibsor.zip" on your hard drive, and click "Open".


INSTALLATION OF R/geesibsor (Unix)

  1. We'll assume that R has already been installed.

  2. Go into the directory containing the file "geesibsor_*.tar.gz".

  3. Do one of the following:

     a. To install R/geesibsor in the standard location
        (/usr/local/lib/R/library), type

            R INSTALL geesibsor_*.tar.gz

        You'll probably need to be superuser.

     b. To install the package locally, type

            R INSTALL --library=/home/auser/Rlibs geesibsor_*.tar.gz

        (where "/home/auser/Rlibs" should be replaced with the
        appropriate directory).

        Create a file ~/.Renviron containing the line

            R_LIBS=/home/auser/Rlibs

        so that R will know to search for packages in that directory.


GETTING STARTED

  Once you start R, you'll need to type "library(geesibsor)" to load
  the package.  You can create a file "~/.Rprofile" (Unix),
  "c:\.Rprofile" (Windows)containing R code to be run whenever you
  start R.  If you use the R/geesibsor package regularly, you should
  place the line "library(geesibsor)" in such a file.

  To get started with R/geesibsor, you might first peruse the
  documentation that is bundled with it.  Type help.start() to start
  the html version of the R help pages.  Then click "Packages" ->
  "geesibsor".

  In Windows, you may gain access to the help documents by clicking
  "Help" in the menu bar and then "R language (html)".  Windows users
  may wish to place the line "options(htmlhelp=TRUE)" in the file
  "c:\.Rprofile" (Windows).


QUESTIONS/COMMENTS/CONCERNS

  regarding R/geesibsor, please email Karl Broman <broman@wisc.edu>.
